This fork of terpstra keyboard is mostly intended for personal use but available just in case someone finds the changes useful.

* Most instruments were normalized to have more consistent volume across different notes;
* 3 more instruments were added;
* The sustain-by-shake feature was removed as it was rather annoying. Instead, for mobile usage, a sustain toggle button was added in the bottom right;
* A centerpoint factor option was added to make it possible to move the center of the keyboard around horizontally. A factor of 2 means it's in the center, as in the original version, higher factor it to the left, lower factor - to the right (i. e. the center is at 100% / factor).
